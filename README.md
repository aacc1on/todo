## ‚öôÔ∏è VPS Deployment Notes

The app is deployed on a VPS using the following setup:

* **PM2 Process Name:** `hsahakyanproject`
* **Running Port:** `14542`
* **Nginx Configuration:**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name mytodolistdevhack.duckdns.org;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:14542;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

## ü§ù Multi-Developer VPS Strategy

To avoid conflicts when deploying multiple projects on the same VPS:

* Each user is assigned a **unique port** (e.g., 14542, 14543, ‚Ä¶)
* Nginx routes traffic based on domain/subdomain or subpath
* Each app is managed independently with PM2 using unique process names
* Shared documentation helps track port usage and configurations
